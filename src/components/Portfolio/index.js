              <p>
                I used CSS and HTML to create the early start of my porfolio. This project was fun! I really enjoyed coming up with a design for this. I learned that starting with a mockup is SUPER helpful when it comes to web design. It is a lot easier to build something when you know what to build. I don't have any projects, so I wasn't able to link anything yet, but the space is ready and avaliable for it.

              <p>Admittedly, I had trouble with this project. But I think it turned out as good as it could. I had fun with the HTML and the styling of it but the javascript was hard. I am still getting the hang of functions but I feel like I was able to grasp it a little bit better than the last project. It's still going to take more practice.</p>

              <p>It was fun adding the timer and figuing out how to decrement time for wrong answers. I hope to continue to get better at Javascript as I do it more!</p>

              <p>I actually had fun working on this project! I feel like things are getting easier and easier to understand and figure out. I still want more practice with javascript, but I think that this point I can read it farily well. It's writing it that i am still strugglings with.</p>

               <p> My favorite part was the design, obvi. But I also liked adding the cute icons to the 5-day weather forcast. I also ran into an issue I couldn't figure out. Whenever I would try to make the 5-day forcast start on the next day, it would only show a four-day forcast. Still didn't figure that out!</p>
