          <p>My name is Sarah and I have been working in the eCommerce space since graduating college back in 2017. In that time, I have learned how to increase and maintain profitability, lead the buildout of multiple Shopify storefronts, create a successful Amazon Proseller account, foster a team of exceptional employees and learn valuable project management skills.</p>
          
          <p>I have recently started pursing a career in web developement, something I have been passionate about since taking a college class years ago. I am excited to start a new career where I can problem solve on a daily basis and foster creativity in my work.</p>
