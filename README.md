React Challenge: React Portfolio

## Your Task

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

## Project Description

I was able to recreate my portfolio that I built at the beginning of class. It was so fun to use my knowledge from the class and become better at development!
